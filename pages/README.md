This is a repository holding the skeleton code for your website coding project this week.

## Task

Explore this project to get a grasp of the HTML, CSS and JS used in this website.

Start with the `index` files then `clock` which contain fully working code that you can play around with.

Then have a look at filling in the blanks of the `pomodoro` files to get it working too.

## Running the project

To run your code, open `index.html` in your browser.
